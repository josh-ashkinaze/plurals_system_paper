      "DETAILED OVERVIEW\n",
      "This amendment would make changes to the state's initiative process and requirements , including: establishing a single-subject rule for initiatives (both statutory and constitutional), as determined by the North Dakota Secretary of State; increasing the signature requirement for constitutional amendment initiatives from 4% of the resident population to 5% of the resident population of the state; and requiring proposed constitutional initiatives that have qualified for the ballot to be placed on the next primary election ballot in June, and, if approved, be placed on the next general election ballot in November, where it must be approved again to become effective.  A single-subject rule is a state law that requires ballot initiatives to address a single subject, topic, or issue. There are 26 states that provide for at least one type of statewide citizen-initiated measure. Of those 26 states, 17 have single-subject rules. As of 2023, North Dakota was one of nine states that provide for at least one type of statewide citizen-initiated measure and that did not have a single-subject rule. The last ballot measure to provide for a single-subject rule for initiatives was Arizona Proposition 129 , which was approved by a vote of 55% of voters in favor and 45% opposed. Nevada is the only state where initiated constitutional amendments must be approved at two consecutive elections. This does not apply to legislatively referred constitutional amendments, which must be approved twice by the legislature (with a majority vote) but only once by the stateâ€™s voters. Since the double election requirement was created in 1962, there have been 15 citizen-initiated constitutional amendments that passed at the first election and appeared on the ballot again at the next election. Of the 15 measures, 13 were passed at their second elections (86.66%) and two failed (13.33%). Question 9 (1982) was rejected with 58.77% of the vote after it was approved with 70.31% of the vote in 1980 . Question 3 (2018) was rejected with 67.05% of the vote after it was approved with 72.36% of the vote in 2016 .\n"

      "This measure would change deadlines for filing initiative and referendum petition signatures to remove one week in order to allow one extra week for the secretary of state to certify ballot order and content and election officials' deadline to transmit ballots. Specifically, the amendment would: change initiative petition filing deadline to three months and one week prior to the election (rather than three months); change referendum petition filing to 83 days after adjournment of the legislative session (rather than 90 days); change the deadline for the text and title of every measure to be published from at least 15 days prior to the final date of voter registration for the election to 45 days before the election; and change deadlines for justices and judges to file declarations of intent to run for another term from not more than 6 months or less than 3 months prior to the general election before the expiration of the judge's term to not more than 6 months and one week or less than 3 months and one week before that general election. To put a legislatively referred constitutional amendment before voters, a two-thirds (66.67%) vote is required in both the Colorado State Senate and the Colorado House of Representatives . The amendment was introduced as Senate Concurrent Resolution 24-002. It was approved in the Senate on April 29, 2024, by a vote of 34-1. It was passed in the House on May 5, 2024, by a vote of 61-1.\n"

At the time of the election, Arkansas was one of eight states that did not have a state lottery. Under the 2008 amendment, lottery proceeds were designed to be used to fund scholarships and grants for students enrolled in ""public and private non-profit two-year and four-year colleges and universities located within the state that are certified according to criteria established by the General Assembly. "" Since the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery (ASL) started in 2009, it has provided more than 720,000 college scholarships, awarded $4. 6 billion in prizes, given $386 million in retailer commissions, and provided approximately $167 million in state and federal tax revenue. The ASL reported a record-high amount of proceeds in fiscal year 2023, with $114,767,979 in proceeds and $607,561,125 in sales. Since the Arkansas Scholarship Lottery was established in 2009, ASL has raised approximately $1. 2 billion in scholarship funds. The funds raised by the ASL are allocated to scholarships managed by the Arkansas Department of Higher Education. These include the Arkansas Academic Challenge Scholarship, the Arkansas Workforce Challenge Scholarship, and the Arkansas Concurrent Challenge Scholarship. During the 2023 legislative session, the state legislature create the Arkansas Challenge Plus Scholarship, which was set to be awarded to students receiving the Academic Challenge Scholarship, based on their financial need, beginning in 2024. The amendment was introduced by Republican Representative Robin Lundstrum (R-18). It was approved unanimously in the Arkansas State Legislature during the 2023 legislative session. Speaking about why the amendment was sponsored, Shane Broadway, vice president for university relations for the Arkansas State University System, said, ""As we worked on developing the scholarship program, we were told by our attorneys we could not include state-owned vocational-technical schools because they were not included in the definition in the constitutional amendment.

Under the amendment, judicial discipline cases would become public once formal proceedings begin, rather than confidential until the process is complete. Rep. Mike Weissman (D-36), who sponsored the amendment in the state House, said, ""Independent oversight is key to the maintenance of trust in any institution, especially public institutions. . .. As members of the legislature, we found that Colorado’s decades-old judicial discipline system did not meet the modern standards of independence and public accountability necessary for public trust. . .. Instead of remaining confidential and out of public view until near the end of the process, judicial discipline matters would be open (as most other court proceedings are) once formal proceedings commence. . .. This new independent board would act like a 'court' for formal judicial discipline proceedings and determine what sanctions are appropriate. . .. In situations when Colorado Supreme Court justices are potentially involved in disciplinary proceedings, they would be removed from their usual role in the appellate review process and replaced by seven randomly selected judges of the Colorado Court of Appeals.

DESCRIPTION
Creates an independent judicial discipline adjudicative board and create rules for the judicial discipline process

VOTING
-A ""yes"" vote supports creating an independent judicial discipline adjudicative board and create rules for the judicial discipline process.

-A ""no"" vote opposes creating an independent judicial discipline adjudicative board and create rules for the judicial discipline process.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
The amendment would create the Independent Judicial Discipline Adjudicative Board, consisting of four district court judges, four attorneys, and four citizens, which would conduct disciplinary hearings and hear appeals relating to disciplinary actions from the Commission on Judicial Discipline. Under the amendment, judicial discipline cases would become public once formal proceedings begin, rather than confidential until the process is complete. Rep. Mike Weissman (D-36), who sponsored the amendment in the state House, said, ""Independent oversight is key to the maintenance of trust in any institution, especially public institutions. . .. As members of the legislature, we found that Colorado’s decades-old judicial discipline system did not meet the modern standards of independence and public accountability necessary for public trust. . .. Instead of remaining confidential and out of public view until near the end of the process, judicial discipline matters would be open (as most other court proceedings are) once formal proceedings commence. . .. This new independent board would act like a 'court' for formal judicial discipline proceedings and determine what sanctions are appropriate. . .. In situations when Colorado Supreme Court justices are potentially involved in disciplinary proceedings, they would be removed from their usual role in the appellate review process and replaced by seven randomly selected judges of the Colorado Court of Appeals. Finally, while preserving the confidentiality of complainants, witnesses, and judges not yet sanctioned through formal proceedings, our constitution would make it clear that the public has a right to know aggregate, non-identifiable data about what is going on in our judicial discipline system and that complainants have a right to be kept informed about ongoing investigations.

Provide for an annual inflation adjustment for the value of the homestead property tax exemption

VOTING
-A ""yes"" vote supports an annual inflation adjustment to the amount of assessed value that is exempt from property taxation.

-A ""no"" vote opposes an annual inflation adjustment to the amount of assessed value that is exempt from property taxation.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
As of 2024, in Florida, property tax (millage) rates were set by counties, school districts, cities, and special districts. Homes in Florida are assessed at just value (market value), minus the homestead exemption. The homestead exemption reduces the taxable value of a property. Every primary residence is eligible for a $25,000 homestead exemption, which exempts that amount from all taxes. Another $25,000 homestead exemption is applied on a homestead's value between $50,000 and $75,000, which exempts that amount from all taxes except school district taxes. The amendment would provide for an annual inflation adjustment for the value of the homestead property tax exemption that applies to non-school taxes.

Article 13, Section 1 currently describes these entities as “institutions for the benefit of the insane, blind and deaf and dumb. ” The word institutions would be replaced with entities under this amendment, and the insane, blind, deaf and dumb would be replaced with persons with significant mental illness, persons who are blind or visually impaired, persons who are deaf or hard of hearing and persons with intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities. In 1988, Washington voters approved a constitutional amendment that amended Section 3 of Article VI and Section 1 of Article XIII of the Washington Constitution, removing references to ""idiots, insane, dumb, and defective youth"". Voters approved the amendment by 81. 37%-18. 63% on November 8, 1988. In 2024, there will be a measure on the North Dakota ballot that would amend language used in the state constitution to describe certain state institutions such as changing ""insane"" to ""individuals with mental illness"", ""feebleminded"" to ""individuals with developmental disabilities"", and ""deaf and dumb"" to ""deaf and hard of hearing. "" The amendment was placed on the ballot by the North Dakota State Legislature. The Senate approved the amendment unanimously on January 16, 2023. The amendment was approved unanimously in the House on March 22, 2023. In order for the Nevada State Legislature to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot for voters to approve, it needs to pass each chamber of the legislature in two consecutive legislative sessions. The amendment was introduced to the 2021-2022 legislative session as Assembly Joint Resolution 1 (AJR 1). On April 13, 2021, the Nevada State Assembly approved the amendment by 42-0, and on May 17, the Nevada State Senate approved the amendment by 21-0. On February 6, 2023, the amendment was returned from the secretary of state to the legislature. On March 29, 2023, the Assembly approved the measure by 41-0. On May 26, 2023, the Senate approved the measure by 20-0.

The amendment would create the Independent Public Service Compensation Commission to set salaries for the governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, attorney general, Bureau of Labor and Industries Commissioner, supreme court judges and other judges governed by the Oregon Judicial Department, district attorneys, state senators, and state representatives. The amendment authorizes the commission to establish different classes of salaries for officials holding positions within those state offices. The amendment would authorize the Oregon State Legislature to pass laws to establish the number of members and establish classes of individuals ineligible from being a member of the commission. The amendment would prohibit the following from serving on the commission: an officer or employee of the state; an individual required to register with any state agency as a lobbyist; and an immediate family member of an individual described in the first two bullet points. The amendment would also prohibit the compensation of judges from being diminished during their terms. Oregon previously had a Oregon Public Officials Compensation Commission that was created in 1983 via legislation. After becoming inactive, it was re-established in 2007. The commission had 11 members appointed by elected officials tasked with making salary recommendations for the governor, secretary of state, treasurer, attorney general, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Commissioner of Labor and Industries, members of the state legislature (including the majority and minority leadership positions), judges of the Supreme Court, judges of the Court of Appeals, and judges of the Tax and Circuit courts. The commission did not receive funding to operate after 2008 and was eliminated in 2017.

State Rep. Adam Morgan (R-20) said, ""Many said [non-citizen voting] was a non-issue. Then we discovered state agencies sending voter registration forms to non-citizens. These 'non-issues' keep turning out to be major issues. "" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster (R) requested the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) to investigate claims made by State Rep. Adam Morgan (R-20) that voter registration forms had been sent to a noncitizen refugee. Gov. McMaster released a statement on May 16, 2024, saying, ""The SLED investigation has confirmed the integrity of South Carolina’s voter registration system, as previous official audits have confirmed. Agencies are properly complying with state and federal voter registration laws, and no evidence of unlawful activity was found. In addition, the SLED report highlights that the citizenship verification policies and procedures being followed by state election officials are designed to prevent non-citizens from becoming eligible to vote. ” In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting noncitizens from voting in federal elections, such as U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and presidential elections. Federal law did not address state or local elections. All state constitutions mention United States citizenship when discussing who can vote in that state's elections. In 43 states, constitutional language discussing citizenship says who can vote (e. g. ""every citizen"" or ""all citizens""), but does not state that noncitizens cannot vote. In seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Ohio) the states' constitutions provide that citizens, but not noncitizens, have the right to vote.

DESCRIPTION
Provide in the state constitution that only a citizen (rather than every citizen) of the U.S. may vote

VOTING
-A ""yes"" vote supports amending the state constitution to add language that only U. S. citizens who are 18 years old or older can vote in elections.

-A ""no"" vote opposes amending the state constitution to add language that only U. S. citizens who are 18 years old or older can vote in elections, rather than every citizen.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
This measure would prohibit local governments from allowing noncitizens to vote by providing in the state constitution that only a citizen of the U.S., rather than every citizen of the U.S., can vote. State Rep. Adam Morgan (R-20) said, ""Many said [non-citizen voting] was a non-issue. Then we discovered state agencies sending voter registration forms to non-citizens. These 'non-issues' keep turning out to be major issues. "" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster (R) requested the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) to investigate claims made by State Rep. Adam Morgan (R-20) that voter registration forms had been sent to a noncitizen refugee. Gov. McMaster released a statement on May 16, 2024, saying, ""The SLED investigation has confirmed the integrity of South Carolina’s voter registration system, as previous official audits have confirmed. Agencies are properly complying with state and federal voter registration laws, and no evidence of unlawful activity was found. In addition, the SLED report highlights that the citizenship verification policies and procedures being followed by state election officials are designed to prevent non-citizens from becoming eligible to vote. ” In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed a law prohibiting noncitizens from voting in federal elections, such as U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and presidential elections. Federal law did not address state or local elections. All state constitutions mention United States citizenship when discussing who can vote in that state's elections. In 43 states, constitutional language discussing citizenship says who can vote (e. g. ""every citizen"" or ""all citizens""), but does not state that noncitizens cannot vote. In seven states (Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Ohio) the states' constitutions provide that citizens, but not noncitizens, have the right to vote. In 2018, 2020, and 2022, constitutional amendments to state that only a citizen (rather than every citizen) may vote were approved in six states . South Carolina voters will join Iowa, Kentucky, and Wisconsin voters in deciding on ballot questions to add language to their respective state constitutions to provide that only U.S. citizens can vote in elections.

It would provide for possession limits of 2 ounces of marijuana, 16 grams of concentrated cannabis, and 1,600 mg of THC contained in cannabis products. Individuals could also possess up to six marijuana plants with no more than 12 plants per household. Plants must be kept in a private residence, in a locked space, and are not visible from a public space. The possession, ingestion, and distribution of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia still will remain illegal for individuals under the age of 21, as well as operating a vehicle or inside of an operated vehicle while under the influence of marijuana. Individuals will not be able to use marijuana on the grounds of any preschool, elementary school, high school, or juvenile detention facility. The smoking of cannabis will be prohibited in public places or where smoking tobacco is prohibited. This measure will not require employers to permit or accommodate employees engaged in the conduct allowed in the measure, or affect an employer’s ability to restrict the use of cannabis by an employee. This is the third time South Dakota voters are deciding on legalizing recreational marijuana. In 2020, South Dakota voters approved Constitutional Amendment A by a vote of 54. 18%-45. 82% to legalize recreational marijuana. Voters also approved Initiated Measure 26 in the same election, which legalized medical marijuana. However, in 2021, Circuit Judge Christina Klinger ruled that the measure was unconstitutional, finding that it violated the state’s single-subject rule and constituted a revision of the constitution rather than an amendment. South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, who also sponsored Amendment A, appealed to the South Dakota Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court ruling. In 2022, South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws qualified another marijuana legalization measure for the ballot, Initiated Measure 27, which would have legalized the recreational use of marijuana for anyone over 21.

DESCRIPTION
Legalize the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana

VOTING
-A ""yes"" vote supports legalizing the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana.

-A ""no"" vote opposes legalizing the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
Initiated Measure 29 would legalize the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia for people who are 21 and over. It would provide for possession limits of 2 ounces of marijuana, 16 grams of concentrated cannabis, and 1,600 mg of THC contained in cannabis products. Individuals could also possess up to six marijuana plants with no more than 12 plants per household. Plants must be kept in a private residence, in a locked space, and are not visible from a public space. The possession, ingestion, and distribution of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia still will remain illegal for individuals under the age of 21, as well as operating a vehicle or inside of an operated vehicle while under the influence of marijuana. Individuals will not be able to use marijuana on the grounds of any preschool, elementary school, high school, or juvenile detention facility. The smoking of cannabis will be prohibited in public places or where smoking tobacco is prohibited. This measure will not require employers to permit or accommodate employees engaged in the conduct allowed in the measure, or affect an employer’s ability to restrict the use of cannabis by an employee. This is the third time South Dakota voters are deciding on legalizing recreational marijuana. In 2020, South Dakota voters approved Constitutional Amendment A by a vote of 54. 18%-45. 82% to legalize recreational marijuana. Voters also approved Initiated Measure 26 in the same election, which legalized medical marijuana. However, in 2021, Circuit Judge Christina Klinger ruled that the measure was unconstitutional, finding that it violated the state’s single-subject rule and constituted a revision of the constitution rather than an amendment. South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, who also sponsored Amendment A, appealed to the South Dakota Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court ruling. In 2022, South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws qualified another marijuana legalization measure for the ballot, Initiated Measure 27, which would have legalized the recreational use of marijuana for anyone over 21. Voters rejected the measure by a vote of 47. 08%-52. 92%. South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws Inc is leading the campaign in support of the initiative. According to reports covering until December 31, 2022, the campaign received $181,249 in contributions. Matthew Schweich, the director of South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, said in support of the measure, ""I think for me, the strongest reason at its core is that if we’re going to allow alcohol to be legal in our society, then it makes absolutely no sense to punish people for using cannabis because alcohol is more harmful to the individual and to society than cannabis.

DESCRIPTION
Allow all employees and self-employed individuals to opt out of paying the tax and receiving benefits under WA Cares, the state's long-term services and supports trust health care program

VOTING
-A ""yes"" vote supports allowing employees and self-employed individuals to opt out of paying the payroll tax and receiving benefits under WA Cares, the state's long-term services and supports trust health care program.

-A ""no"" vote opposes allowing individuals to opt out of WA Cares, the state's long-term services and supports trust health care program that is funded through a mandatory payroll tax.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
This initiative would allow employees and self-employed individuals to opt out of coverage under WA Cares, the state's long-term services and supports trust health care program. An individual that opts out of the program would not be required to pay the payroll tax assessed on employees' wages that funds the program. The Employee Security Department would be responsible for developing rules to implement the opt-in and opt-out processes. WA Cares is a healthcare program funded through a mandatory payroll tax that provides long-term health services benefits (such as home health care, adult day care, nursing home care, and group home care) to qualifying individuals. It is the first state-operated long-term care insurance program in the country. As of 2024, self-employed individuals that opt in to the program cannot opt out of the program unless they become no longer self-employed or retire. As of 2024, the program offered limited pathways for exemptions from paying into the program.

DETAILED OVERVIEW
The amendment would reauthorize the dedication of revenue from the state-operated lottery to the Environment and Natural Resources Fund through December 31, 2050. The amendment would increase the amount of money that can be spent from the fund each year from 5. 5% to 7. 0% of the fund's market value, dedicating the additional 1. 5% to fund a grant program. The amendment would repeal language that authorized loans of up to 5% of the principal of the fund for water system improvements and would add language to prohibit the use of the fund to repay the principal or interest of any bonds or any costs related to the construction, repair, improvement, or operation of any facility or system that processes wastewater. It would authorize the use of funds for research related to wastewater. House File 1900 (HF 1900), the bill passed to put the amendment on the ballot, also included implementing legislation for the amendment that establishes a grant program to expand the diversity of trust fund recipients and provide funding for projects related to addressing environmental issues in affected communities, environmental education, and natural resource conservation. The implementing legislation would take effect if the amendment is approved. Under the legislation, the additional 1. 5% of funds authorized under the constitutional amendment to be expended would be directed to funding the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund Community Grant Program. Grant funds could be awarded to help adversely impacted communities to respond to environmental degradation and related health concerns; fund education and awareness related to stewardship of air, land, water, forests, fish, wildlife, and other natural resources; or fund preserving or enhancing air, land, water, and other natural resources that otherwise may be substantially impaired or destroyed in any area of the state.
